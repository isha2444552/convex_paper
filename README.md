# Collision-free trajectory planning for multiple UAVs using PSO algorithm

[Reference Code] (https://yarpiz.com/403/ypap115-path-planning)

functions used in the code -

CreateModel() - 
CreateRandomSolution() -
ParseSolution() -
MyCost() -
pso() -
PlotSolution()

1) Run pso()
2) User will be asked to enter the starting and ending position of 3 UAVs
3) Optimal trajectories for each UAV will be generated.

Changes done in code - The modified code generates code for multiple UAVs simultaneously and objective function is modified by incorporating the collison condition among UAVs.
